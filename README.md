# Quiz Game

This project is a simple console-based quiz game implemented in Python. The game covers three categories: Programming, Science, and Math. The questions for each category are stored in separate Python files and are imported into the main game script.

## Project Structure

- **random_question_quiz_oop_approach.py**: The OOP approach script of the game.
- **random_question_quiz.py**: The main script to run the quiz game.
- **questions.py**: This file contains the dictionaries of questions for each category.

## Question Categories

- **Programming**: Includes questions related to programming languages, syntax, and general coding knowledge.
- **Science**: Covers various topics in physics, chemistry, biology, and general science.
- **Math**: Contains questions on basic arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and other math concepts.

## Files

- **programming_questions**: A dictionary of programming-related questions and their answers.
- **science_questions**: A dictionary of science-related questions and their answers.
- **math_questions**: A dictionary of math-related questions and their answers.

Each category's questions are stored as key-value pairs where the key is the question and the value is the correct answer. The game randomly selects questions from the chosen category and quizzes the user.
